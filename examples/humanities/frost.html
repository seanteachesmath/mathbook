<div class="line left">Some say the world will end in fire,</div>
<div class="line left">Some say in ice.</div>
<div class="line left">From what I've tasted of desire</div>

<div class="line left">But if it had to perish twice,</div>
<div class="line left">I think I know enough of hate</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">There is a singer everyone has heard,</div>
<div class="line left">Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,</div>
<div class="line left">Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.</div>
<div class="line left">He says that leaves are old and that for flowers</div>
<div class="line left">Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.</div>
<div class="line left">He says the early petal-fall is past</div>
<div class="line left">When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers</div>
<div class="line left">On sunny days a moment overcast;</div>
<div class="line left">And comes that other fall we name the fall.</div>
<div class="line left">He says the highway dust is over all.</div>
<div class="line left">The bird would cease and be as other birds</div>
<div class="line left">But that he knows in singing not to sing.</div>
<div class="line left">The question that he frames in all but words</div>
<div class="line left">Is what to make of a diminished thing.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Love has earth to which she clings</div>
<div class="line left">With hills and circling arms about</div>
<div class="line left">Wall within wall to shut fear out.</div>
<div class="line left">But Thought has need of no such things,</div>
<div class="line left">For Thought has a pair of dauntless wings.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">On snow and sand and turf, I see</div>
<div class="line left">Where Love has left a printed trace</div>
<div class="line left">With straining in the world's embrace.</div>
<div class="line left">And such is Love and glad to be.</div>
<div class="line left">But Thought has shaken his ankles free.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Thought cleaves the interstellar gloom</div>
<div class="line left">And sits in Sirius' disc all night,</div>
<div class="line left">Till day makes him retrace his flight,</div>
<div class="line left">With smell of burning on every plume,</div>
<div class="line left">Back past the sun to an earthly room.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">His gains in heaven are what they are.</div>
<div class="line left">Yet some say Love by being thrall</div>
<div class="line left">And simply staying possesses all</div>
<div class="line left">In several beauty that Thought fares far</div>

<div class="line left">You come to fetch me from my work tonight</div>
<div class="line left">When supper's on the table, and we'll see</div>
<div class="line left">If I can leave off burying the white</div>
<div class="line left">Soft petals fallen from the apple tree.</div>
<div class="line left">(Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,</div>
<div class="line left">Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea;)</div>
<div class="line left">And go along with you ere you lose sight</div>
<div class="line left">Of what you came for and become like me,</div>
<div class="line left">Slave to a springtime passion for the earth.</div>
<div class="line left">How Love burns through the Putting in the Seed</div>
<div class="line left">On through the watching for that early birth</div>
<div class="line left">When, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,</div>
<div class="line left">The sturdy seedling with arched body comes</div>
<div class="line left">Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
<div class="line left">And sorry I could not travel both</div>
<div class="line left">And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
<div class="line left">And looked down one as far as I could</div>
<div class="line left">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
<div class="line left">And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
<div class="line left">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
<div class="line left">Though as for that the passing there</div>
<div class="line left">Had worn them really about the same,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And both that morning equally lay</div>
<div class="line left">In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
<div class="line left">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</div>
<div class="line left">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
<div class="line left">I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
<div class="line left">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
<div class="line left">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ</div>
<div class="line left">I took the one less traveled by,</div>
<div class="line left">And that has made all the difference.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The house had gone to bring again</div>
<div class="line left">To the midnight sky a sunset glow.</div>
<div class="line left">Now the chimney was all of the house that stood,</div>
<div class="line left">Like a pistil after the petals go.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The barn opposed across the way,</div>
<div class="line left">That would have joined the house in flame</div>
<div class="line left">Had it been the will of the wind, was left</div>
<div class="line left">To bear forsaken the place's name.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">No more it opened with all one end</div>
<div class="line left">For teams that came by the stony road</div>
<div class="line left">To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs</div>
<div class="line left">And brush the mow with the summer load.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The birds that came to it through the air</div>
<div class="line left">At broken windows flew out and in,</div>
<div class="line left">Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh</div>
<div class="line left">From too much dwelling on what has been.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,</div>
<div class="line left">And the aged elm, though touched with fire;</div>
<div class="line left">And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;</div>
<div class="line left">And the fence post carried a strand of wire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">For them there was really nothing sad.</div>
<div class="line left">But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,</div>
<div class="line left">One had to be versed in country things</div>
<div class="line left">Not to believe the phoebes wept.</div>
</div>
<div class="author left">Robert Frost</div></article><article class="poem" id="poem-18"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Mending Wall</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Something there is that doesn't love a wall,</div>
<div class="line left">That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,</div>
<div class="line left">And spills the upper boulders in the sun;</div>
<div class="line left">And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.</div>
<div class="line left">The work of hunters is another thing:</div>
<div class="line left">I have come after them and made repair</div>
<div class="line left">Where they have left not one stone on a stone,</div>
<div class="line left">But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,</div>
<div class="line left">To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,</div>
<div class="line left">No one has seen them made or heard them made,</div>
<div class="line left">But at spring mending-time we find them there.</div>
<div class="line left">I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;</div>
<div class="line left">And on a day we meet to walk the line</div>
<div class="line left">And set the wall between us once again.</div>
<div class="line left">We keep the wall between us as we go.</div>
<div class="line left">To each the boulders that have fallen to each.</div>
<div class="line left">And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</div>
<div class="line left">We have to use a spell to make them balance:</div>
<div class="line left">ââStay where you are until our backs are turned!ââ</div>
<div class="line left">We wear our fingers rough with handling them.</div>
<div class="line left">Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,</div>
<div class="line left">One on a side. It comes to little more:</div>
<div class="line left">There where it is we do not need the wall:</div>
<div class="line left">He is all pine and I am apple orchard.</div>
<div class="line left">My apple trees will never get across</div>
<div class="line left">And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.</div>
<div class="line left">He only says, ââGood fences make good neighbors.ââ</div>
<div class="line left">Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder</div>
<div class="line left">If I could put a notion in his head:</div>
<div class="line left">âWhy do they make good neighbors? Isn't it</div>
<div class="line left">Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.</div>
<div class="line left">Before I built a wall I'd ask to know</div>
<div class="line left">What I was walling in or walling out,</div>
<div class="line left">And to whom I was like to give offense.</div>
<div class="line left">Something there is that doesn't love a wall,</div>
<div class="line left">That wants it down.â I could say ââElvesââ to him,</div>
<div class="line left">But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather</div>
<div class="line left">He said it for himself. I see him there</div>
<div class="line left">Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</div>
<div class="line left">In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.</div>
<div class="line left">He moves in darkness as it seems to me,</div>
<div class="line left">Not of woods only and the shade of trees.</div>
<div class="line left">He will not go behind his father's saying,</div>
<div class="line left">And he likes having thought of it so well</div>
<div class="line left">He says again, ââGood fences make good neighbors.ââ</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree</div>
<div class="line left">Toward heaven still,</div>
<div class="line left">And there's a barrel that I didn't fill</div>
<div class="line left">Beside it, and there may be two or three</div>
<div class="line left">Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.</div>
<div class="line left">But I am done with apple-picking now.</div>
<div class="line left">Essence of winter sleep is on the night,</div>
<div class="line left">The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.</div>
<div class="line left">I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight</div>
<div class="line left">I got from looking through a pane of glass</div>
<div class="line left">I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough</div>
<div class="line left">And held against the world of hoary grass.</div>
<div class="line left">It melted, and I let it fall and break.</div>
<div class="line left">But I was well</div>
<div class="line left">Upon my way to sleep before it fell,</div>
<div class="line left">And I could tell</div>
<div class="line left">What form my dreaming was about to take.</div>
<div class="line left">Magnified apples appear and disappear,</div>
<div class="line left">Stem end and blossom end,</div>
<div class="line left">And every fleck of russet showing clear.</div>
<div class="line left">My instep arch not only keeps the ache,</div>
<div class="line left">It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.</div>
<div class="line left">I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.</div>
<div class="line left">And I keep hearing from the cellar bin</div>
<div class="line left">The rumbling sound</div>
<div class="line left">Of load on load of apples coming in.</div>
<div class="line left">For I have had too much</div>
<div class="line left">Of apple-picking: I am overtired</div>
<div class="line left">Of the great harvest I myself desired.</div>
<div class="line left">There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,</div>
<div class="line left">Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.</div>
<div class="line left">For all</div>
<div class="line left">That struck the earth,</div>
<div class="line left">No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,</div>
<div class="line left">Went surely to the cider-apple heap</div>
<div class="line left">As of no worth.</div>
<div class="line left">One can see what will trouble</div>
<div class="line left">This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.</div>
<div class="line left">Were he not gone,</div>
<div class="line left">The woodchuck could say whether it's like his</div>
<div class="line left">Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,</div>
<div class="line left">Or just some human sleep.</div>

<div class="author left">Robert Frost</div></article><article class="poem" id="poem-20"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The Wood-pile</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day</div>
<div class="line left">I paused and said, âI will turn back from here.</div>
<div class="line left">No, I will go on fartherâand we shall see.â</div>
<div class="line left">The hard snow held me, save where now and then</div>
<div class="line left">One foot went down. The view was all in lines</div>
<div class="line left">Straight up and down of tall slim trees</div>
<div class="line left">Too much alike to mark or name a place by</div>
<div class="line left">So as to say for certain I was here</div>
<div class="line left">Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.</div>
<div class="line left">A small bird flew before me. He was careful</div>
<div class="line left">To put a tree between us when he lighted,</div>
<div class="line left">And say no word to tell me who he was</div>
<div class="line left">Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.</div>
<div class="line left">He thought that I was after him for a featherâ</div>
<div class="line left">The white one in his tail; like one who takes</div>
<div class="line left">Everything said as personal to himself.</div>
<div class="line left">One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.</div>
<div class="line left">And then there was a pile of wood for which</div>
<div class="line left">I forgot him and let his little fear</div>
<div class="line left">Carry him off the way I might have gone,</div>
<div class="line left">Without so much as wishing him good-night.</div>
<div class="line left">He went behind it to make his last stand.</div>
<div class="line left">It was a cord of maple, cut and split</div>
<div class="line left">And piled and measured, four by four by eight.</div>
<div class="line left">And not another like it could I see.</div>
<div class="line left">No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.</div>
<div class="line left">And it was older sure than this year's cutting,</div>
<div class="line left">Or even last year's or the year's before.</div>
<div class="line left">The wood was gray and the bark warping off it</div>
<div class="line left">And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis</div>
<div class="line left">Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.</div>
<div class="line left">What held it though on one side was a tree</div>
<div class="line left">Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,</div>
<div class="line left">These latter about to fall. I thought that only</div>
<div class="line left">Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks</div>
<div class="line left">Could so forget his handiwork on which</div>
<div class="line left">He spent himself, the labor of his axe,</div>
<div class="line left">And leave it there far from a useful fireplace</div>
<div class="line left">To warm the frozen swamp as best it could</div>
<div class="line left">With the slow smokeless burning of decay.</div>

<div class="line left">I went to show you how to make it stay,</div>
<div class="line left">If that was your idea, against the breeze,</div>
<div class="line left">And, if you asked me, even help pretend</div>
<div class="line left">To make it root again and grow afresh.</div>
<div class="line left">But 'twas no make-believe with you to-day,</div>
<div class="line left">Nor was the grass itself your real concern,</div>
<div class="line left">Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,</div>
<div class="line left">Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover.</div>
<div class="line left">'Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground</div>
<div class="line left">The cutter-bar had just gone champing over</div>
<div class="line left">(Miraculously without tasting flesh)</div>
<div class="line left">And left defenseless to the heat and light.</div>
<div class="line left">You wanted to restore them to their right</div>
<div class="line left">Of something interposed between their sight</div>
<div class="line left">And too much world at once-could means be found.</div>
<div class="line left">The way the nest-full every time we stirred</div>
<div class="line left">Stood up to us as to a mother-bird</div>
<div class="line left">Whose coming home has been too long deferred,</div>
<div class="line left">Made me ask would the mother-bird return</div>
<div class="line left">And care for them in such a change of scene</div>
<div class="line left">And might our meddling make her more afraid.</div>
<div class="line left">That was a thing we could not wait to learn.</div>
<div class="line left">We saw the risk we took in doing good,</div>
<div class="line left">But dared not spare to do the best we could</div>
<div class="line left">Though harm should come of it; so built the screen</div>
<div class="line left">You had begun, and gave them back their shade.</div>
<div class="line left">All this to prove we cared. Why is there then</div>
<div class="line left">No more to tell? We turned to other things.</div>
<div class="line left">I haven't any memory-have you?</div>
<div class="line left">Of ever coming to the place again</div>
<div class="line left">To see if the birds lived the first night through,</div>
<div class="line left">And so at last to learn to use their wings.</div>
