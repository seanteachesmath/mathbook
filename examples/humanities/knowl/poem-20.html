<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The Wood-pile</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day</div>
<div class="line left">I paused and said, “I will turn back from here.</div>
<div class="line left">No, I will go on farther—and we shall see.”</div>
<div class="line left">The hard snow held me, save where now and then</div>
<div class="line left">One foot went down. The view was all in lines</div>
<div class="line left">Straight up and down of tall slim trees</div>
<div class="line left">Too much alike to mark or name a place by</div>
<div class="line left">So as to say for certain I was here</div>
<div class="line left">Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.</div>
<div class="line left">A small bird flew before me. He was careful</div>
<div class="line left">To put a tree between us when he lighted,</div>
<div class="line left">And say no word to tell me who he was</div>
<div class="line left">Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.</div>
<div class="line left">He thought that I was after him for a feather—</div>
<div class="line left">The white one in his tail; like one who takes</div>
<div class="line left">Everything said as personal to himself.</div>
<div class="line left">One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.</div>
<div class="line left">And then there was a pile of wood for which</div>
<div class="line left">I forgot him and let his little fear</div>
<div class="line left">Carry him off the way I might have gone,</div>
<div class="line left">Without so much as wishing him good-night.</div>
<div class="line left">He went behind it to make his last stand.</div>
<div class="line left">It was a cord of maple, cut and split</div>
<div class="line left">And piled and measured, four by four by eight.</div>
<div class="line left">And not another like it could I see.</div>
<div class="line left">No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.</div>
<div class="line left">And it was older sure than this year's cutting,</div>
<div class="line left">Or even last year's or the year's before.</div>
<div class="line left">The wood was gray and the bark warping off it</div>
<div class="line left">And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis</div>
<div class="line left">Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.</div>
<div class="line left">What held it though on one side was a tree</div>
<div class="line left">Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,</div>
<div class="line left">These latter about to fall. I thought that only</div>
<div class="line left">Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks</div>
<div class="line left">Could so forget his handiwork on which</div>
<div class="line left">He spent himself, the labor of his axe,</div>
<div class="line left">And leave it there far from a useful fireplace</div>
<div class="line left">To warm the frozen swamp as best it could</div>
<div class="line left">With the slow smokeless burning of decay.</div>
