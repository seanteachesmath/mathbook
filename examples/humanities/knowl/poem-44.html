<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Tithonos</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,</div>
<div class="line left">The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,</div>
<div class="line left">Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,</div>
<div class="line left">And after many a summer dies the swan.</div>
<div class="line left">Me only cruel immortality</div>
<div class="line left">Consumes; I wither slowly in thine arms,</div>
<div class="line left">Here at the quiet limit of the world,</div>
<div class="line left">A white-hair'd shadow roaming like a dream</div>
<div class="line left">The ever-silent spaces of the East,</div>
<div class="line left">Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.</div>
<div class="line left">Alas! for this gray shadow, once a man—</div>
<div class="line left">So glorious in his beauty and thy choice,</div>
<div class="line left">Who madest him thy chosen, that he seem'd</div>
<div class="line left">To his great heart none other than a God!</div>
<div class="line left">I ask'd thee, “Give me immortality.”</div>
<div class="line left">Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,</div>
<div class="line left">Like wealthy men who care not how they give.</div>
<div class="line left">But thy strong Hours indignant work'd their wills,</div>
<div class="line left">And beat me down and marr'd and wasted me,</div>
<div class="line left">And tho' they could not end me left me maim'd</div>
<div class="line left">To dwell in presence of immortal youth,</div>
<div class="line left">Immortal age beside immortal youth,</div>
<div class="line left">And all I was in ashes. Can thy love</div>
<div class="line left">Thy beauty, make amends, tho' even now,</div>
<div class="line left">Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,</div>
<div class="line left">Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears</div>
<div class="line left">To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift:</div>
<div class="line left">Why should a man desire in any way</div>
<div class="line left">To vary from the kindly race of men,</div>
<div class="line left">Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance</div>
<div class="line left">Where all should pause, as if most meet for all?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">A soft air fans the cloud apart; there comes</div>
<div class="line left">A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.</div>
<div class="line left">Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals</div>
<div class="line left">From any pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,</div>
<div class="line left">And bosom beating with a heart renew'd.</div>
<div class="line left">Thy cheek begins to redden thro' the gloom,</div>
<div class="line left">Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,</div>
<div class="line left">Ere yet they blind t he stars, and the wild team</div>
<div class="line left">Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,</div>
<div class="line left">And shake the darkness from their loosen'd manes,</div>
<div class="line left">And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.</div>
<div class="line left">Lo! ever thus thou growest beautiful</div>
<div class="line left">In silence, then before thine answer given</div>
<div class="line left">Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,</div>
<div class="line left">And make me tremble lest a saying learnt,</div>
<div class="line left">In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true?</div>
<div class="line left">“The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Ay me! ay me! with what another heart</div>
<div class="line left">In days far-off, and with what other eyes</div>
<div class="line left">I used to watch {if I be he that watch'd}</div>
<div class="line left">The lucid outline forming round thee; saw</div>
<div class="line left">The dim curls kindle into sunny rings;</div>
<div class="line left">Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood</div>
<div class="line left">Glow with the glow that slowly crimson'd all</div>
<div class="line left">Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay,</div>
<div class="line left">Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm</div>
<div class="line left">With kisses balmier than half-opening buds</div>
<div class="line left">Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss'd</div>
<div class="line left">Whispering I knew now what of wild and sweet,</div>
<div class="line left">Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing,</div>
<div class="line left">While Ilion like a mist rose into towers.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet hold me not for ever in thine East;</div>
<div class="line left">How can my nature longer mix with thine?</div>
<div class="line left">Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold</div>
<div class="line left">Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet</div>
<div class="line left">Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam</div>
<div class="line left">Floats up from those dim fields about the homes</div>
<div class="line left">Of happy men that have the power to die,</div>
<div class="line left">And grassy barrows of the happier dead.</div>
<div class="line left">Release me, and restore me to the ground;</div>
<div class="line left">Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my grave:</div>
<div class="line left">Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;</div>
<div class="line left">I earth in earth forget these empty courts,</div>
<div class="line left">And thee returning on thy silver wheels.</div>
