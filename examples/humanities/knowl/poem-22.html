<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">O Captain! My Captain</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</div>
<div class="line left">The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,</div>
<div class="line left">The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</div>
<div class="line left">While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</div>
<div class="line left">But O heart! heart! heart!</div>
<div class="line left">O the bleeding drops of red,</div>
<div class="line left">Where on the deck my Captain lies,</div>
<div class="line left">Fallen cold and dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</div>
<div class="line left">Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,</div>
<div class="line left">For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,</div>
<div class="line left">For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</div>
<div class="line left">Here Captain! dear father!</div>
<div class="line left">This arm beneath your head!</div>
<div class="line left">It is some dream that on the deck,</div>
<div class="line left">You've fallen cold and dead.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,</div>
<div class="line left">My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</div>
<div class="line left">The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</div>
<div class="line left">From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</div>
<div class="line left">Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</div>
<div class="line left">But I with mournful tread,</div>
<div class="line left">Walk the deck my Captain lies,</div>
<div class="line left">Fallen cold and dead.</div>
