<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">There is a singer everyone has heard,</div>
<div class="line left">Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,</div>
<div class="line left">Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.</div>
<div class="line left">He says that leaves are old and that for flowers</div>
<div class="line left">Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.</div>
<div class="line left">He says the early petal-fall is past</div>
<div class="line left">When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers</div>
<div class="line left">On sunny days a moment overcast;</div>
<div class="line left">And comes that other fall we name the fall.</div>
<div class="line left">He says the highway dust is over all.</div>
<div class="line left">The bird would cease and be as other birds</div>
<div class="line left">But that he knows in singing not to sing.</div>
<div class="line left">The question that he frames in all but words</div>
<div class="line left">Is what to make of a diminished thing.</div>
