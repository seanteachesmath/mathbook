<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Ulysses</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">It little profits that an idle king,</div>
<div class="line left">By this still hearth, among these barren crags,</div>
<div class="line left">Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole</div>
<div class="line left">Unequal laws unto a savage race,</div>
<div class="line left">That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I cannot rest from travel: I will drink</div>
<div class="line left">Life to the lees; all times I have enjoy'd</div>
<div class="line left">Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those</div>
<div class="line left">That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when</div>
<div class="line left">Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades</div>
<div class="line left">Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;</div>
<div class="line left">For always roaming with a hungry heart</div>
<div class="line left">Much have I seen and known; cities of men</div>
<div class="line left">And manners, climates, councils, governments,</div>
<div class="line left">Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;</div>
<div class="line left">And drunk delight of battle with my peers,</div>
<div class="line left">Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy,</div>
<div class="line left">I am a part of all that I have met;</div>
<div class="line left">Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'</div>
<div class="line left">Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades</div>
<div class="line left">For ever and for ever when I move.</div>
<div class="line left">How dull it is to pause, to make an end,</div>
<div class="line left">To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!</div>
<div class="line left">As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life</div>
<div class="line left">Were all too little, and of one to me</div>
<div class="line left">Little remains: but every hour is saved</div>
<div class="line left">From that eternal silence, something more,</div>
<div class="line left">A bringer of new things; and vile it were</div>
<div class="line left">For some three suns to store and hoard myself,</div>
<div class="line left">And this gray spirit yearning in desire</div>
<div class="line left">To follow knowledge like a sinking star,</div>
<div class="line left">Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">
<span class="tab"></span>This is my son, mine own Telemachus,</div>
<div class="line left">To whom I leave the scepter and the isleâ€”</div>
<div class="line left">Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil</div>
<div class="line left">This labour, by slow prudence to make mild</div>
<div class="line left">A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees</div>
<div class="line left">Subdue them to the useful and the good.</div>
<div class="line left">Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere</div>
<div class="line left">Of common duties, decent not to fail</div>
<div class="line left">In offices of tenderness, and pay</div>
<div class="line left">Meet adoration to my household gods,</div>
<div class="line left">When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">
<span class="tab"></span>There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:</div>
<div class="line left">There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,</div>
<div class="line left">Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me</div>
<div class="line left">That ever with a frolic welcome took</div>
<div class="line left">The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed</div>
<div class="line left">Free hearts, free foreheads-you and I are old;</div>
<div class="line left">Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;</div>
<div class="line left">Death closes all: but something ere the end,</div>
<div class="line left">Some work of noble note, may yet be done,</div>
<div class="line left">Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.</div>
<div class="line left">The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:</div>
<div class="line left">The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep</div>
<div class="line left">Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,</div>
<div class="line left">'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</div>
<div class="line left">Push off, and sitting well in order smite</div>
<div class="line left">The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds</div>
<div class="line left">To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</div>
<div class="line left">Of all the western stars, until I die.</div>
<div class="line left">It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</div>
<div class="line left">It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</div>
<div class="line left">And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</div>
<div class="line left">Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'</div>
<div class="line left">We are not now that strength which in old days</div>
<div class="line left">Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;</div>
<div class="line left">One equal temper of heroic hearts,</div>
<div class="line left">Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</div>
<div class="line left">To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</div>
