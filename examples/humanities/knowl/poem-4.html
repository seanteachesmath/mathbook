<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Easter 1916</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">I</span></h6>
<div class="line center">I have met them at close of day</div>
<div class="line center">Coming with vivid faces</div>
<div class="line center">From counter or desk among grey</div>
<div class="line center">Eighteenth-century houses.</div>
<div class="line center">I have passed with a nod of the head</div>
<div class="line center">Or polite meaningless words,</div>
<div class="line center">Or have lingered awhile and said</div>
<div class="line center">Polite meaningless words,</div>
<div class="line center">And thought before I had done</div>
<div class="line center">Of a mocking tale or a gibe</div>
<div class="line center">To please a companion</div>
<div class="line center">Around the fire at the club,</div>
<div class="line center">Being certain that they and I</div>
<div class="line center">But lived where motley is worn:</div>
<div class="line center">All changed, changed utterly:</div>
<div class="line center">A terrible beauty is born.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">II</span></h6>
<div class="line center">That woman's days were spent</div>
<div class="line center">In ignorant good-will,</div>
<div class="line center">Her nights in argument</div>
<div class="line center">Until her voice grew shrill.</div>
<div class="line center">What voice more sweet than hers</div>
<div class="line center">When, young and beautiful,</div>
<div class="line center">She rode to harriers?</div>
<div class="line center">This man had kept a school</div>
<div class="line center">And rode our winged horse;</div>
<div class="line center">This other his helper and friend</div>
<div class="line center">Was coming into his force;</div>
<div class="line center">He might have won fame in the end,</div>
<div class="line center">So sensitive his nature seemed,</div>
<div class="line center">So daring and sweet his thought.</div>
<div class="line center">This other man I had dreamed</div>
<div class="line center">A drunken, vainglorious lout.</div>
<div class="line center">He had done most bitter wrong</div>
<div class="line center">To some who are near my heart,</div>
<div class="line center">Yet I number him in the song;</div>
<div class="line center">He, too, has resigned his part</div>
<div class="line center">In the casual comedy;</div>
<div class="line center">He, too, has been changed in his turn,</div>
<div class="line center">Transformed utterly:</div>
<div class="line center">A terribly beauty is born.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">III</span></h6>
<div class="line center">Hearts with one purpose alone</div>
<div class="line center">Through summer and winter seem</div>
<div class="line center">Enchanted to a stone</div>
<div class="line center">To trouble the living stream.</div>
<div class="line center">The horse that comes from the road,</div>
<div class="line center">The rider, the birds that range</div>
<div class="line center">From cloud to tumbling cloud,</div>
<div class="line center">Minute by minute they change;</div>
<div class="line center">A shadow of cloud on the stream</div>
<div class="line center">Changes minute by minute;</div>
<div class="line center">A horse-hoof slides on the brim,</div>
<div class="line center">And a horse plashed within it;</div>
<div class="line center">The long-legged moor-hens dive,</div>
<div class="line center">And hens to moor-cocks call;</div>
<div class="line center">Minute by minute they live:</div>
<div class="line center">The stone's in the midst of all.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">IV</span></h6>
<div class="line center">Too long a sacrifice</div>
<div class="line center">Can make a stone of the heart.</div>
<div class="line center">O when may it suffice?</div>
<div class="line center">That is Heaven's part, our part</div>
<div class="line center">To murmur name upon name,</div>
<div class="line center">As a mother names her child</div>
<div class="line center">When sleep at last has come</div>
<div class="line center">On limbs that had run wild.</div>
<div class="line center">What is it but nightfall?</div>
<div class="line center">No, no, not night but death;</div>
<div class="line center">Was it needless death after all?</div>
<div class="line center">For England may keep faith</div>
<div class="line center">For all that is done and said.</div>
<div class="line center">We know their dream; enough</div>
<div class="line center">To know they dreamed and are dead;</div>
<div class="line center">And what if excess of love</div>
<div class="line center">Bewildered them till they died?</div>
<div class="line center">I write it out in a verse -</div>
<div class="line center">MacDonagh and MacBride</div>
<div class="line center">And Connolly and Pearse</div>
<div class="line center">Now and in time to be,</div>
<div class="line center">Wherever green is worn,</div>
<div class="line center">Are changed, changed utterly:</div>
<div class="line center">A terrible beauty is born.</div>
