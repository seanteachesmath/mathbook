<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
<div class="line left">And sorry I could not travel both</div>
<div class="line left">And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
<div class="line left">And looked down one as far as I could</div>
<div class="line left">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
<div class="line left">And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
<div class="line left">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
<div class="line left">Though as for that the passing there</div>
<div class="line left">Had worn them really about the same,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And both that morning equally lay</div>
<div class="line left">In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
<div class="line left">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</div>
<div class="line left">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
<div class="line left">I doubted if I should ever come back.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
<div class="line left">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
<div class="line left">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</div>
<div class="line left">I took the one less traveled by,</div>
<div class="line left">And that has made all the difference.</div>
