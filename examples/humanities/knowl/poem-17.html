<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The Need of Being Versed in Country Things</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The house had gone to bring again</div>
<div class="line left">To the midnight sky a sunset glow.</div>
<div class="line left">Now the chimney was all of the house that stood,</div>
<div class="line left">Like a pistil after the petals go.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The barn opposed across the way,</div>
<div class="line left">That would have joined the house in flame</div>
<div class="line left">Had it been the will of the wind, was left</div>
<div class="line left">To bear forsaken the place's name.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">No more it opened with all one end</div>
<div class="line left">For teams that came by the stony road</div>
<div class="line left">To drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs</div>
<div class="line left">And brush the mow with the summer load.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The birds that came to it through the air</div>
<div class="line left">At broken windows flew out and in,</div>
<div class="line left">Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh</div>
<div class="line left">From too much dwelling on what has been.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,</div>
<div class="line left">And the aged elm, though touched with fire;</div>
<div class="line left">And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;</div>
<div class="line left">And the fence post carried a strand of wire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">For them there was really nothing sad.</div>
<div class="line left">But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,</div>
<div class="line left">One had to be versed in country things</div>
<div class="line left">Not to believe the phoebes wept.</div>
