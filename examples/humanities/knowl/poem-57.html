<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The Wild Common</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,</div>
<div class="line left">Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;</div>
<div class="line left">Above them, exultant, the pee-wits are sweeping:</div>
<div class="line left">They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie</div>
<div class="line left">Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.</div>
<div class="line left">Are they asleep?—Are they alive?—Now see, when I</div>
<div class="line left">Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes</div>
<div class="line left">Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;</div>
<div class="line left">There the lazy streamlet pushes</div>
<div class="line left">Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,</div>
<div class="line left">Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,</div>
<div class="line left">Naked on the steep, soft lip</div>
<div class="line left">Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?</div>
<div class="line left">Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook?</div>
<div class="line left">If my veins and my breasts with love embossed</div>
<div class="line left">Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">So my soul like a passionate woman turns,</div>
<div class="line left">Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love</div>
<div class="line left">For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,</div>
<div class="line left">Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,</div>
<div class="line left">Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.</div>
<div class="line left">And the soul of the wind and my blood compare</div>
<div class="line left">Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Oh but the water loves me and folds me,</div>
<div class="line left">Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,</div>
<div class="line left">Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,</div>
<div class="line left">Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.</div>
