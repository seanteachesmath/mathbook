<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Mending Wall</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Something there is that doesn't love a wall,</div>
<div class="line left">That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,</div>
<div class="line left">And spills the upper boulders in the sun;</div>
<div class="line left">And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.</div>
<div class="line left">The work of hunters is another thing:</div>
<div class="line left">I have come after them and made repair</div>
<div class="line left">Where they have left not one stone on a stone,</div>
<div class="line left">But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,</div>
<div class="line left">To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,</div>
<div class="line left">No one has seen them made or heard them made,</div>
<div class="line left">But at spring mending-time we find them there.</div>
<div class="line left">I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;</div>
<div class="line left">And on a day we meet to walk the line</div>
<div class="line left">And set the wall between us once again.</div>
<div class="line left">We keep the wall between us as we go.</div>
<div class="line left">To each the boulders that have fallen to each.</div>
<div class="line left">And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</div>
<div class="line left">We have to use a spell to make them balance:</div>
<div class="line left">“”Stay where you are until our backs are turned!“”</div>
<div class="line left">We wear our fingers rough with handling them.</div>
<div class="line left">Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,</div>
<div class="line left">One on a side. It comes to little more:</div>
<div class="line left">There where it is we do not need the wall:</div>
<div class="line left">He is all pine and I am apple orchard.</div>
<div class="line left">My apple trees will never get across</div>
<div class="line left">And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.</div>
<div class="line left">He only says, “”Good fences make good neighbors.“”</div>
<div class="line left">Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder</div>
<div class="line left">If I could put a notion in his head:</div>
<div class="line left">“Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it</div>
<div class="line left">Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.</div>
<div class="line left">Before I built a wall I'd ask to know</div>
<div class="line left">What I was walling in or walling out,</div>
<div class="line left">And to whom I was like to give offense.</div>
<div class="line left">Something there is that doesn't love a wall,</div>
<div class="line left">That wants it down.” I could say “”Elves“” to him,</div>
<div class="line left">But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather</div>
<div class="line left">He said it for himself. I see him there</div>
<div class="line left">Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</div>
<div class="line left">In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.</div>
<div class="line left">He moves in darkness as it seems to me,</div>
<div class="line left">Not of woods only and the shade of trees.</div>
<div class="line left">He will not go behind his father's saying,</div>
<div class="line left">And he likes having thought of it so well</div>
<div class="line left">He says again, “”Good fences make good neighbors.“”</div>
