<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">I saw in Lousiana a live oak growing</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,</div>
<div class="line left">All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,</div>
<div class="line left">Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green,</div>
<div class="line left">And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,</div>
<div class="line left">But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could not,</div>
<div class="line left">And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss,</div>
<div class="line left">And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,</div>
<div class="line left">It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,</div>
<div class="line left">(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)</div>
<div class="line left">Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;</div>
<div class="line left">For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide flat space,</div>
<div class="line left">Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,</div>
<div class="line left">I know very well I could not.</div>
