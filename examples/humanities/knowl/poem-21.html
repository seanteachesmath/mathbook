<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">The Exposed Nest</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">You were forever finding some new play.</div>
<div class="line left">So when I saw you down on hands and knees</div>
<div class="line left">In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,</div>
<div class="line left">Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,</div>
<div class="line left">I went to show you how to make it stay,</div>
<div class="line left">If that was your idea, against the breeze,</div>
<div class="line left">And, if you asked me, even help pretend</div>
<div class="line left">To make it root again and grow afresh.</div>
<div class="line left">But 'twas no make-believe with you to-day,</div>
<div class="line left">Nor was the grass itself your real concern,</div>
<div class="line left">Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,</div>
<div class="line left">Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover.</div>
<div class="line left">'Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground</div>
<div class="line left">The cutter-bar had just gone champing over</div>
<div class="line left">(Miraculously without tasting flesh)</div>
<div class="line left">And left defenseless to the heat and light.</div>
<div class="line left">You wanted to restore them to their right</div>
<div class="line left">Of something interposed between their sight</div>
<div class="line left">And too much world at once-could means be found.</div>
<div class="line left">The way the nest-full every time we stirred</div>
<div class="line left">Stood up to us as to a mother-bird</div>
<div class="line left">Whose coming home has been too long deferred,</div>
<div class="line left">Made me ask would the mother-bird return</div>
<div class="line left">And care for them in such a change of scene</div>
<div class="line left">And might our meddling make her more afraid.</div>
<div class="line left">That was a thing we could not wait to learn.</div>
<div class="line left">We saw the risk we took in doing good,</div>
<div class="line left">But dared not spare to do the best we could</div>
<div class="line left">Though harm should come of it; so built the screen</div>
<div class="line left">You had begun, and gave them back their shade.</div>
<div class="line left">All this to prove we cared. Why is there then</div>
<div class="line left">No more to tell? We turned to other things.</div>
<div class="line left">I haven't any memory-have you?</div>
<div class="line left">Of ever coming to the place again</div>
<div class="line left">To see if the birds lived the first night through,</div>
<div class="line left">And so at last to learn to use their wings.</div>
