<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Arm'd year-year of the struggle,</div>
<div class="line left">No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,</div>
<div class="line left">Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano,</div>
<div class="line left">But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a rifle on your shoulder,</div>
<div class="line left">With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in the belt at your side,</div>
<div class="line left">As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the continent,</div>
<div class="line left">Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,</div>
<div class="line left">Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the dwellers in Manhattan,</div>
<div class="line left">Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,</div>
<div class="line left">Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Alleghanies,</div>
<div class="line left">Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the Ohio river,</div>
<div class="line left">Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at Chattanooga on the mountain top,</div>
<div class="line left">Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing weapons, robust year,</div>
</div>
