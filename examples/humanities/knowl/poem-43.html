<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Locksley Hall</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn:</div>
<div class="line left">Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">'Tis the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,</div>
<div class="line left">Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,</div>
<div class="line left">And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,</div>
<div class="line left">Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,</div>
<div class="line left">Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime</div>
<div class="line left">With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;</div>
<div class="line left">When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;</div>
<div class="line left">Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;</div>
<div class="line left">In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;</div>
<div class="line left">In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,</div>
<div class="line left">And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And I said, ‘My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,</div>
<div class="line left">Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee.’</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,</div>
<div class="line left">As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And she turn'd-her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs—</div>
<div class="line left">All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Saying, ‘I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong’;</div>
<div class="line left">Saying, ‘Dost thou love me, cousin?’ weeping, ‘I have loved thee long’.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;</div>
<div class="line left">Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;</div>
<div class="line left">Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,</div>
<div class="line left">And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,</div>
<div class="line left">And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!</div>
<div class="line left">O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,</div>
<div class="line left">Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Is it well to wish thee happy?-having known me-to decline</div>
<div class="line left">On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level day by day,</div>
<div class="line left">What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathise with clay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,</div>
<div class="line left">And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,</div>
<div class="line left">Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">What is this? his eyes are heavy: think not they are glazed with wine.</div>
<div class="line left">Go to him: it is thy duty: kiss him: take his hand in thine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:</div>
<div class="line left">Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand—</div>
<div class="line left">Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,</div>
<div class="line left">Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!</div>
<div class="line left">Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!</div>
<div class="line left">Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Well-'tis well that I should bluster!-Hadst thou less unworthy proved—</div>
<div class="line left">Would to God-for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?</div>
<div class="line left">I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come</div>
<div class="line left">As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?</div>
<div class="line left">Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I remember one that perish'd: sweetly did she speak and move:</div>
<div class="line left">Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?</div>
<div class="line left">No-she never loved me truly: love is love for evermore.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,</div>
<div class="line left">That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,</div>
<div class="line left">In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,</div>
<div class="line left">Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,</div>
<div class="line left">To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Thou shalt hear the ‘Never, never,’ whisper'd by the phantom years,</div>
<div class="line left">And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.</div>
<div class="line left">Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow: get thee to thy rest again.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry,</div>
<div class="line left">'Tis a purer life than thine; a lip to drain thy trouble dry.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Baby lips will laugh me down: my latest rival brings thee rest.</div>
<div class="line left">Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.</div>
<div class="line left">Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,</div>
<div class="line left">With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">‘They were dangerous guides the feelings-she herself was not exempt—</div>
<div class="line left">Truly, she herself had suffer'd’—Perish in thy self-contempt!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Overlive it-lower yet-be happy! wherefore should I care,</div>
<div class="line left">I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?</div>
<div class="line left">Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.</div>
<div class="line left">I have but an angry fancy: what is that which I should do?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,</div>
<div class="line left">When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with sound.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels,</div>
<div class="line left">And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.</div>
<div class="line left">Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,</div>
<div class="line left">When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,</div>
<div class="line left">Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,</div>
<div class="line left">Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,</div>
<div class="line left">Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:</div>
<div class="line left">That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,</div>
<div class="line left">Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,</div>
<div class="line left">Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew</div>
<div class="line left">From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,</div>
<div class="line left">With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunder-storm;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd</div>
<div class="line left">In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,</div>
<div class="line left">And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">So I triumph'd, ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,</div>
<div class="line left">Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint,</div>
<div class="line left">Science moves, but slowly slowly, creeping on from point to point:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,</div>
<div class="line left">Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,</div>
<div class="line left">And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,</div>
<div class="line left">Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,</div>
<div class="line left">And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,</div>
<div class="line left">Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,</div>
<div class="line left">They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string?</div>
<div class="line left">I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain</div>
<div class="line left">Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine,</div>
<div class="line left">Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat</div>
<div class="line left">Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd;—</div>
<div class="line left">I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Or to burst all links of habit-there to wander far away,</div>
<div class="line left">On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,</div>
<div class="line left">Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,</div>
<div class="line left">Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from the crag;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree—</div>
<div class="line left">Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind,</div>
<div class="line left">In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and breathing-space;</div>
<div class="line left">I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run,</div>
<div class="line left">Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks.</div>
<div class="line left">Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I know my words are wild,</div>
<div class="line left">But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains,</div>
<div class="line left">Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Mated with a squalid savage-what to me were sun or clime?</div>
<div class="line left">I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,</div>
<div class="line left">Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range.</div>
<div class="line left">Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Thro' the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day:</div>
<div class="line left">Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:</div>
<div class="line left">Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the Sun—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set.</div>
<div class="line left">Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!</div>
<div class="line left">Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,</div>
<div class="line left">Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;</div>
<div class="line left">For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.</div>
