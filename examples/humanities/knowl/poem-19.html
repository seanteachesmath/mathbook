<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">After Apple-picking</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree</div>
<div class="line left">Toward heaven still,</div>
<div class="line left">And there's a barrel that I didn't fill</div>
<div class="line left">Beside it, and there may be two or three</div>
<div class="line left">Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.</div>
<div class="line left">But I am done with apple-picking now.</div>
<div class="line left">Essence of winter sleep is on the night,</div>
<div class="line left">The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.</div>
<div class="line left">I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight</div>
<div class="line left">I got from looking through a pane of glass</div>
<div class="line left">I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough</div>
<div class="line left">And held against the world of hoary grass.</div>
<div class="line left">It melted, and I let it fall and break.</div>
<div class="line left">But I was well</div>
<div class="line left">Upon my way to sleep before it fell,</div>
<div class="line left">And I could tell</div>
<div class="line left">What form my dreaming was about to take.</div>
<div class="line left">Magnified apples appear and disappear,</div>
<div class="line left">Stem end and blossom end,</div>
<div class="line left">And every fleck of russet showing clear.</div>
<div class="line left">My instep arch not only keeps the ache,</div>
<div class="line left">It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.</div>
<div class="line left">I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.</div>
<div class="line left">And I keep hearing from the cellar bin</div>
<div class="line left">The rumbling sound</div>
<div class="line left">Of load on load of apples coming in.</div>
<div class="line left">For I have had too much</div>
<div class="line left">Of apple-picking: I am overtired</div>
<div class="line left">Of the great harvest I myself desired.</div>
<div class="line left">There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,</div>
<div class="line left">Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.</div>
<div class="line left">For all</div>
<div class="line left">That struck the earth,</div>
<div class="line left">No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,</div>
<div class="line left">Went surely to the cider-apple heap</div>
<div class="line left">As of no worth.</div>
<div class="line left">One can see what will trouble</div>
<div class="line left">This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.</div>
<div class="line left">Were he not gone,</div>
<div class="line left">The woodchuck could say whether it's like his</div>
<div class="line left">Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,</div>
<div class="line left">Or just some human sleep.</div>
