<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Piccadilly Circus at Night</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">When into the night the yellow light is roused like dust above the towns,</div>
<div class="line left">Or like a mist the moon has kissed from off a pool in the midst of the downs,</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Our faces flower for a little hour pale and uncertain along the street,</div>
<div class="line left">Daisies that waken all mistaken white-spread in expectancy to meet</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">The luminous mist which the poor things wist was dawn arriving across the sky,</div>
<div class="line left">When dawn is far behind the star the dust-lit town has driven so high.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">All the birds are folded in a silent ball of sleep,</div>
<div class="line left">All the flowers are faded from the asphalt isle in the sea,</div>
<div class="line left">Only we hard-faced creatures go round and round, and keep</div>
<div class="line left">The shores of this innermost ocean alive and illusory.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Wanton sparrows that twittered when morning looked in at their eyes</div>
<div class="line left">And the Cyprian's pavement-roses are gone, and now it is we</div>
<div class="line left">Flowers of illusion who shine in our gauds, make a Paradise</div>
<div class="line left">On the shores of this ceaseless ocean, gay birds of the town-dark sea.</div>
