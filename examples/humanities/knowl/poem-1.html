<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Why should I blame her that she filled my days</div>
<div class="line left">With misery, or that she would of late</div>
<div class="line left">Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,</div>
<div class="line left">Or hurled the little streets upon the great,</div>
<div class="line left">Had they but courage equal to desire?</div>
<div class="line left">What could have made her peaceful with a mind</div>
<div class="line left">That nobleness made simple as a fire,</div>
<div class="line left">With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind</div>
<div class="line left">That is not natural in an age like this,</div>
<div class="line left">Being high and solitary and most stern?</div>
<div class="line left">Why, what could she have done, being what she is?</div>
<div class="line left">Was there another Troy for her to burn?</div>
