<article class="poem"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Old Ireland</span></h6>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,</div>
<div class="line left">Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,</div>
<div class="line left">Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,</div>
<div class="line left">Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,</div>
<div class="line left">At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,</div>
<div class="line left">Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and heir,</div>
<div class="line left">Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet a word ancient mother,</div>
<div class="line left">You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead between your knees,</div>
<div class="line left">O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,</div>
<div class="line left">For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,</div>
<div class="line left">It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,</div>
<div class="line left">The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in another country,</div>
<div class="line left">Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,</div>
<div class="line left">What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,</div>
<div class="line left">The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,</div>
<div class="line left">And now with rosy and new blood,</div>
<div class="line left">Moves to-day in a new country.</div>
