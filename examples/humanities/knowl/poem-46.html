<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">All along the valley, stream that flashest white,</div>
<div class="line left">Deepening thy voice with the deepening of the night,</div>
<div class="line left">All along the valley, where thy waters flow,</div>
<div class="line left">I walked with one I loved two and thirty years ago.</div>
<div class="line left">All along the valley while I walked to-day,</div>
<div class="line left">The two and thirty years were a mist that rolls away;</div>
<div class="line left">For all along the valley, down thy rocky bed,</div>
<div class="line left">Thy living voice to me was as the voice of the dead,</div>
<div class="line left">And all along the valley, by rock and cave and tree,</div>
<div class="line left">The voice of the dead was a living voice to me.</div>
