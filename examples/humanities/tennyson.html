<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">It little profits that an idle king,</div>
<div class="line left">By this still hearth, among these barren crags,</div>
<div class="line left">Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole</div>
<div class="line left">Unequal laws unto a savage race,</div>
<div class="line left">That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I cannot rest from travel: I will drink</div>
<div class="line left">Life to the lees; all times I have enjoy'd</div>
<div class="line left">Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those</div>
<div class="line left">That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when</div>
<div class="line left">Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades</div>
<div class="line left">Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;</div>
<div class="line left">For always roaming with a hungry heart</div>
<div class="line left">Much have I seen and known; cities of men</div>
<div class="line left">And manners, climates, councils, governments,</div>
<div class="line left">Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;</div>
<div class="line left">And drunk delight of battle with my peers,</div>
<div class="line left">Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy,</div>
<div class="line left">I am a part of all that I have met;</div>
<div class="line left">Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'</div>
<div class="line left">Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades</div>
<div class="line left">For ever and for ever when I move.</div>
<div class="line left">How dull it is to pause, to make an end,</div>
<div class="line left">To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!</div>
<div class="line left">As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life</div>
<div class="line left">Were all too little, and of one to me</div>
<div class="line left">Little remains: but every hour is saved</div>
<div class="line left">From that eternal silence, something more,</div>
<div class="line left">A bringer of new things; and vile it were</div>
<div class="line left">For some three suns to store and hoard myself,</div>
<div class="line left">And this gray spirit yearning in desire</div>
<div class="line left">To follow knowledge like a sinking star,</div>
<div class="line left">Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">
<span class="tab"></span>This is my son, mine own Telemachus,</div>
<div class="line left">To whom I leave the scepter and the isle—</div>
<div class="line left">Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil</div>
<div class="line left">This labour, by slow prudence to make mild</div>
<div class="line left">A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees</div>
<div class="line left">Subdue them to the useful and the good.</div>
<div class="line left">Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere</div>
<div class="line left">Of common duties, decent not to fail</div>
<div class="line left">In offices of tenderness, and pay</div>
<div class="line left">Meet adoration to my household gods,</div>
<div class="line left">When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">
<span class="tab"></span>There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:</div>
<div class="line left">There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,</div>
<div class="line left">Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me</div>
<div class="line left">That ever with a frolic welcome took</div>
<div class="line left">The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed</div>
<div class="line left">Free hearts, free foreheads-you and I are old;</div>
<div class="line left">Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;</div>
<div class="line left">Death closes all: but something ere the end,</div>
<div class="line left">Some work of noble note, may yet be done,</div>
<div class="line left">Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.</div>
<div class="line left">The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:</div>
<div class="line left">The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep</div>
<div class="line left">Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,</div>
<div class="line left">'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.</div>
<div class="line left">Push off, and sitting well in order smite</div>
<div class="line left">The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds</div>
<div class="line left">To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths</div>
<div class="line left">Of all the western stars, until I die.</div>
<div class="line left">It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:</div>
<div class="line left">It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,</div>
<div class="line left">And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.</div>
<div class="line left">Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'</div>
<div class="line left">We are not now that strength which in old days</div>
<div class="line left">Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;</div>
<div class="line left">One equal temper of heroic hearts,</div>
<div class="line left">Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will</div>
<div class="line left">To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn:</div>
<div class="line left">Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">'Tis the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,</div>
<div class="line left">Dreary gleams about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,</div>
<div class="line left">And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,</div>
<div class="line left">Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,</div>
<div class="line left">Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime</div>
<div class="line left">With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;</div>
<div class="line left">When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;</div>
<div class="line left">Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;</div>
<div class="line left">In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;</div>
<div class="line left">In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,</div>
<div class="line left">And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And I said, ‘My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,</div>
<div class="line left">Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee.’</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,</div>
<div class="line left">As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And she turn'd-her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs—</div>
<div class="line left">All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes—</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Saying, ‘I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong’;</div>
<div class="line left">Saying, ‘Dost thou love me, cousin?’ weeping, ‘I have loved thee long’.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;</div>
<div class="line left">Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;</div>
<div class="line left">Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,</div>
<div class="line left">And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,</div>
<div class="line left">And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!</div>
<div class="line left">O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,</div>
<div class="line left">Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Is it well to wish thee happy?-having known me-to decline</div>
<div class="line left">On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level day by day,</div>
<div class="line left">What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathise with clay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,</div>
<div class="line left">And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,</div>
<div class="line left">Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">What is this? his eyes are heavy: think not they are glazed with wine.</div>
<div class="line left">Go to him: it is thy duty: kiss him: take his hand in thine.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:</div>
<div class="line left">Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand—</div>
<div class="line left">Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,</div>
<div class="line left">Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!</div>
<div class="line left">Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!</div>
<div class="line left">Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Well-'tis well that I should bluster!-Hadst thou less unworthy proved—</div>
<div class="line left">Would to God-for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?</div>
<div class="line left">I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come</div>
<div class="line left">As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?</div>
<div class="line left">Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">I remember one that perish'd: sweetly did she speak and move:</div>
<div class="line left">Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?</div>
<div class="line left">No-she never loved me truly: love is love for evermore.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,</div>
<div class="line left">That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,</div>
<div class="line left">In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,</div>
<div class="line left">Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,</div>
<div class="line left">To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Thou shalt hear the ‘Never, never,’ whisper'd by the phantom years,</div>
<div class="line left">And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.</div>
<div class="line left">Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow: get thee to thy rest again.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry,</div>
<div class="line left">'Tis a purer life than thine; a lip to drain thy trouble dry.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Baby lips will laugh me down: my latest rival brings thee rest.</div>
<div class="line left">Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.</div>
<div class="line left">Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,</div>
<div class="line left">With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">‘They were dangerous guides the feelings-she herself was not exempt—</div>
<div class="line left">Truly, she herself had suffer'd’—Perish in thy self-contempt!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Overlive it-lower yet-be happy! wherefore should I care,</div>
<div class="line left">I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?</div>
<div class="line left">Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.</div>

<div class="line left">Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood</div>

<div class="line left">Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay,</div>
<div class="line left">Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm</div>
<div class="line left">With kisses balmier than half-opening buds</div>
<div class="line left">Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss'd</div>
<div class="line left">Whispering I knew now what of wild and sweet,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="line left">Yet hold me not for ever in thine East;</div>
<div class="line left">How can my nature longer mix with thine?</div>
<div class="line left">Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold</div>
<div class="line left">Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet</div>
<div class="line left">Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam</div>
<div class="line left">Floats up from those dim fields about the homes</div>
<div class="line left">Of happy men that have the power to die,</div>
<div class="line left">And grassy barrows of the happier dead.</div>
<div class="line left">Release me, and restore me to the ground;</div>
<div class="line left">Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my grave:</div>
<div class="line left">Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;</div>
<div class="line left">I earth in earth forget these empty courts,</div>
