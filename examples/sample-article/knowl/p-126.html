<p>This is a <dfn class="terminology">reading question</dfn> that you might have a student answer prior to a class session, based on reading part of the book. A quick glance before class can help you tailor class time to the specific needs of your students. The perfect reading question will reveal whether the student has read and understood the material, and will be difficult to answer if they have not. What do you think of that?</p>
