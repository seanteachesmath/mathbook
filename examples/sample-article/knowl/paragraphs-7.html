<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Characters in <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span>, PDF, print.</span></h5>
<p>The situation for <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> is a bit more complicated, since <span class="latex-logo">T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> pre-dates Unicode's widespread adoption.</p>
<p>This sample article is intended to work well, out-of-the-box, for authors just starting with PreTeXt.  So we only include here examples that we know are likely to convert to <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> without any errors.  For more extensive examples and experiments, we provide the sample document <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</code>, so be aware of that example as you look to see what is possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, you should be able to process this sample article successfully with various <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> engines.  We test regularly with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pdflatex</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xelatex</code> and provide online sample PDF output of this document processed by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pdflatex</code>.  In principle, you should be able to use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">latex</code> (to produce a DVI), and possibly other (unsupported) engines, such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">lualatex</code>.</p>
<p>Once you get beyond the Latin alphabet, with accents common in Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere, you will almost assuredly need to restrict your attention to producing <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr> output with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">xelatex</code> engine.  This is discussed and tested in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</code>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-internationalization.html#paragraphs-7">in-context</a></span>
