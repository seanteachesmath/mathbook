<p>You can also provide a file yourself, but now it is your obligation to distribute the file with your document (<abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr>, <abbr class="initialism">PDF</abbr>, etc.) and provide a relative link.  This creates some complications, such as making sure an electronic PDF has the associated file in the same place relative to the PDF file.  Of course, if you make a print PDF, this becomes impossible.  Here is a test example anyway, which is highly likely to be broken in a PDF (including at the PreTeXt project site) unless you build this example on your own computer, locally.
