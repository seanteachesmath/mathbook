<p>Sage, and the Sage Cell Server, support interactive demonstrations, called <dfn class="terminology">interacts</dfn>.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The interactive elements are nearly trivial to construct.</li>
<li>An interact is simply a single Python function (acted on by a decorator).</li>
<li>You have the full mathematical power of Sage at your disposal, so can do some very powerful computations with high precision (or exactly).</li>
<li>The interface is not as polished as what you can achieve with Javascript libraries.</li>
<li>Graphics refresh with a round-trip to the server, so are not nearly as fluid as with other tools.</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Note that each interact is insulated from the others, unlike our other employment of the Sage Cell Server.</p>
