<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Unicode Characters for HTML Output.</span></h5>
<p>First, we discuss HTML output.  If you include Unicode characters in your PreTeXt source, they should survive just fine <i class="foreign" lang="fr-FR">en route</i> to a web browser or e-reader.  Here are the caveats for HTML output:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>So that you can continue to get the best results with print and PDF output, use available empty elements for obscure characters, even if targeting HTML output, before resorting to a Unicode character.  For example, use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;copyright/&gt;</code> for the copyright symbol in text before resorting to the Unicode character <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">U+00A9</code>.  It is a bit more work, but you will get better results with other conversions, even if you initially are only fascinated by <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr>.</p></li>
<li><p>How you actually enter Unicode characters into your source file is dependent on your editor and operating system, and is therefore outside the scope of our documentation.  You can cut-and-paste characters and text from the source of our examples for initial testing and experimentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Always, always identify your source as having Unicode characters by including the incantation <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;</code> as the first line of your source file. (You <em class="emphasis">may</em> be able to accurately cut-and-paste this version here.  But if the copy has non-standard characters in it, go back to the top of this source file for a copy.)</p></li>
<li><p>Alan Wood’s <a class="external" href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/unicode_samples.html" target="_blank">Unicode Resources</a> has a plethora of samples of various groups of Unicode characters.  If you, or your readers, are “missing” characters in a web browser, this is a good place to start testing the local setup.</p></li>
