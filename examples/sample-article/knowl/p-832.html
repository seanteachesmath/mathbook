<p>In the meantime, program listings, especially with syntax highlighting, is useful all by itself.  The “R” language might not be a bad stand-in for pseudo-code, as it supports assignment with a left arrow and has fairly generic procedural syntax for control structures and data structures.  Or maybe Pascal would be a good choice?  Here is an example of R.  Note in the source that the entire block of code is wrapped in a CDATA section due to the four left angle brackets.  We do not recommend this technique for isolated problem characters, but it is a life-saver for situations like the <abbr class="initialism">XSLT</abbr> code just following.</p>
