<p>There is an index manufactured at the end of the back matter.  So we are talking about it here, rather than within the index, which is an impossibility.  It contains some sample entries, and is not meant to be comprehensive.  Look at the source of this XML file, searching on <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;idx&gt;</code>, to see how they are written.  They may be placed inside of a a variety of structures, and their location greatly influences the cross-references produced in the HTML version of the index.</p>
