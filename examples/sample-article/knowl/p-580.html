<p>One of the goals of PreTeXt is to gently guide authors towards good choices in the design of their documents, even if we do not claim to know it all ourselves.  Take a close look at that table about tables.  What's missing?  No vertical rules.  Try living without them, you will not really miss them.  If you think you need to divide a table into two halves, maybe you really need two tables (and then see the “side-by-side” capabilities, Section <a href="section-side-by-side.html" class="internal" title="Section 23: Side-By-Side Panels">23</a>).</p>
