<p>Jack Green created an applet on the Classroom Resources site with ID <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">D4s2v4ft</code>, which you may view at <a class="external" href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/D4s2v4ft" target="_blank">geogebra.org/m/D4s2v4ft</a>. Suppose you would like to use this in your project, but change something about it. We will change something trivial, making the \(y\)-axis ticks be separated \(5\) apart instead of \(10\) apart. We also decide we want a different aspect ratio and overall width. One gotcha: the original applet is loaded and then PreTeXt uses <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">@width</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">@aspect</code> attributes to resize the viewing window using the top left corner as an anchor. This does not rescale axes and that may leave you with important elements missing from the viewing window. So here we reset the viewing window to return to values that are in the original. Lastly, we disable zooming, which is not helpful for this applet. To do each of these things, we rely on the GeoGebra API manual at <a class="external" href="https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API" target="_blank">wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API</a>. It is important to use one command per line.</p>
