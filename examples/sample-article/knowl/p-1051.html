<p>Once your content is in place, you can begin thinking about various useful derivative works.  A natural example for a textbook is an “Instructor's Version”.  Various switches for hints, answers, and solutions to exercises would allow you to include more of these for the use of just an instructor.  Here we also demonstrate the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code> element.  It is similar in many ways to a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;paragraphs&gt;</code> in that it can be placed within any division and must be titled.  The main difference is that it is not displayed by default, so you must set a processing switch to enable its appearance:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">xsltproc -stringparam commentary yes ...
</pre>
<p data-braille="continuation">Other distinctions are:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Since it is elective, you need to be careful about cross-references to and from a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code>.  It is highly likely that you will want to make cross-references <em class="emphasis">within</em> a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code> <em class="emphasis">pointing to</em> other portions of your text, and this is always a good idea.  You will want to avoid making cross-references <em class="emphasis">to</em> a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code> from other parts of the text, with the exception of a cross-reference that originates <em class="emphasis">within</em> some <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Numbered items are prohibited within a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code>, such as a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;figure&gt;</code> or a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;theorem&gt;</code>.  Doing so would disrupt consecutive numbering in different versions, with or without, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;commentary&gt;</code> included.  Numbered equations are not prohibited in the schema, but should definitely be avoided anyway.</li>
