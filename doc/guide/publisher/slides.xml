    <title>Conversion to Slides</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            As discussed in <xref ref="overview-slides"/> and <xref ref="topic-slides"/>,
            support is available for authoring slideshows in <pretext/>. Currently, slideshows
            must be authored explicitly, but we hope to eventually support annotating
            books and articles to export appropriate content as slides.

        <title>Reveal.js</title>
        <p>
            Run this to produce a Reveal.js slideshow:<cd>
                <cline>xsltproc --xinclude -o path/to/output/slides.html</cline>
                <cline>  path/to/pretext/xsl/pretext-revealjs.xsl path/to/source/slides.xml</cline>
            </cd>

            Reveal.js supports themes that affect the overall appearance of a slideshow.
            So in <pretext/> you can specify the name of theme in a publisher file.
            See <xref ref="revealjs-appearance-options"/> for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may assume that your slideshow will be presented with the internet available,
            perhaps in a classroom, and will be updated for use the next semester.
            Or maybe you are presenting at a conference where you do not want to trust an unfamiliar internet connection,
            and you will later host an archival version of your presentation on your website and you want it to <q>just work</q> ten years from now.
            So you can configure your slideshow to obtain resources from a Content Delivery Network (<init>CDN</init>) online,
            or you may arrange to copy the necessary files from reveal.js and store them locally (your hard disk, your website).
            See <xref ref="revealjs-resources-options"/> for the necessary details.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reveal.js has various options of the visibility of arrows a presenter can click on in order to move through a presentation.
            The visibility of these can be controlled via options in the publisher file.  See <xref ref="revealjs-control-options"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reveal.js imagines slides laid out on a 2-D grid.  Each <pretext/> section gives rise to a title slide and these are organized left-to-right.  <em>Below</em> each of these slides, arranged vertically, are the slides comprising the section.  We use the attribute value <c>grid</c> to refer to this arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
            If public speaking makes you nervous and going left-to-right and top-to-bottom
            nearly simultaneously means you get lost and even less confident (we've seen it),
            we have an option for you.
            The attribute value <c>linear</c> arranges <em>all</em> your slides from left-to-right.
            Aah, that's better.
            See <xref ref="revealjs-navigation-options"/> for details on setting the navigation mode for your slideshow.

    <section xml:id="publisher-beamer">
        <title>Beamer <latex/></title>
        <p>
            Run this to produce a Beamer <latex/> slideshow:<cd>
                <cline>xsltproc --xinclude -o path/to/output/slides.tex</cline>
                <cline>  path/to/pretext/xsl/pretext-beamer.xsl path/to/source/slides.xml</cline>
            </cd>
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, you should then run e.g. <c>pdflatex slides.tex</c> to produce a PDF.
